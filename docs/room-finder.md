# Room Finder Maintenance Documentation [Draft 1.1]

This is intended to explain how the code behind my Room Finder skill works, for maintenance purposes.

I'd like to think it's already a bit better commented and documented than the SDK, but it's a lot simpler too...

# The Alexa SDK API

This brief section is intended to help you use the Alexa SDK Node Module without understanding exactly what's up under the hood. First, do check out Amazon's basic [SDK documentation](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs). You will also likely need the context of the overall [Alexa documentation.](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/getting-started-guide). If you want to know how the SDK works on the backend check out my alexa-sdk documentation.

To just summarize their documentation, the Alexa SDK works on an 'listener' system, where it sets up a handler (which is actually an extension of a Node [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html)) that listens for particular events, then 'emits' other events in response. You set up the intents to listen for, then emit an event in response. They have a preregistered set of listeners (`':tell'`, `':ask'`, `':askWithCard'`, `':tellWithCard'`, `':tellWithLinkAccountCard'`, `':askWithLinkAccountCard'`, `':responseReady'`, `':saveState'`, and `':saveStateError'`) that you can emit to. These will push the parameters you give them to Alexa, and sort the rest of the response object for you. It will only work in AWS Lambda.

Now some details that I think are poorly covered by documentation.

#### Can I emit between different handlers and state handlers?

Yes, you very much can. All the handlers are actually registered together in one big ['EventEmitter'](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html); to allow this without overlapping intent names, intents with states are actually listening for `IntentName_STATEAPPENDED`. When Lambda gets an intent from the Echo, the SDK just appends the state on to the intent before emitting it to the handler. The issue this means that if you write `this.emit('BookIntent')` within any of the state handlers, it will always just call the 'BookIntent' of the 'stateless' handlers. Therefore if you want to call the 'BookIntent' in \_CONFIRMMODE, you have to use `this.emitWithState('BookIntent')` with the correct `this.handler.state`.

#### So how does emitWithState work?

Very simply, it concatenates `this.handler.state` onto the intent parameter, does a bit of error checking, then emits the full string. This means that `this.emitWithState('BookIntent')` actually becomes `this.emit('BookIntent_CONFIRMMODE')`. It is therefore **not** used to emit the state to any of the preregistered handlers, to store the state, or anything like that. `this.emitWithState(':tell')` will return an error, as it will try to emit `this.emit(':tell_CONFIRMMODE')` which doesn't exist. It is only intended to allow movement within and between state handlers.

#### Why can I use 'NewSession', even though it's not an intent? What others are there like that?

It handles certain types for you. The ones it does are 'NewSession' (which overrides any intent if you've made that. listener), 'LaunchRequest', 'Unhandled' (which is called if there are no listeners present), 'SessionEndedRequest', 'AudioPlayer[...]', and 'PlaybackController[...]'. These can all therefore be used as listener keys even though they aren't technically 'intents' as such.

#### Do all listeners need to be intents?

No. I use a bunch of listeners that aren't intents in Room Finder, just to neaten my code.

#### What does `this` refer to in my functions? Maybe the individual handler, or the EventEmitter?

***None of the above.*** It refers to a 'handlerContext' object, which is defined in the SDK backend. If you want the real details of what you can access through this variable, I'd suggest reading the backend documentation I've written up. Here's the basics - when reading this, assume `this` refers to the overall `handler` object whenever used.

```
on: this.on.bind(this),
emit: this.emit.bind(this),
emitWithState: EmitWithState.bind(this),
state: this.state,
handler: this,
i18n: this.i18n,
locale: this.locale,
t : localize, // Function that uses i18n to translate
event: this._event,
attributes: this._event.session.attributes,
context: this._context,
name: eventName,
isOverridden: IsOverridden.bind(this, eventName), //  Function that tells you whether there is more than one. listener for a particular event string.
response: ResponseBuilder(this) // Function that returns a function to generate responses.
```

#### Why can't I reset the state to the default state, an empty string?

At time of writing, there's a bug in the SDK that prevents this. I've submitted a pull request, so I'm hoping they fix it some way or another. In order to workaround this, instead of just putting `this.handler.state =""`, put both these lines:

```
this.handler.state = "";
this.handler.response.sessionAttributes.STATE = "";
```

You only need to do this for the empty string.

#### Can I emit two events at the same time?

Provided you don't need them to happen synchronously, and they don't both send something to Alexa - yes.

# Room Finder

## Structure

Here's the conversation tree that Room Finder uses:

![Conversation Tree](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20475469/24461686/c84a9dae-1499-11e7-9e5b-0db89961eb1b.png)

Simply put, first it asks the user if they want to book a room, then it asks them how long, then it asks them to confirm the booking. Follow right down the center of the tree for the main functionality.

This requires two custom intents, one called BookIntent (which is both used to ask to book, and to confirm a booking), and one called DurationIntent. The code should also support all the specified built-in intents.

All the states are set up and registered as handlers in `lambda/index.js`.

## Files

For abstraction, my code is split into four files. If you want to maintain this structure, please follow these concepts:

- `lambda/index.js` should contain all the main intent handlers, and is what is called by AWS Lambda.
- `lambda/requesters.js` should contain all the functions that make requests to the MS Graph API.
- `lambda/resources.js` should contain all strings used by index.js. (There are a couple of unviewed strings not stored here, in `lambda/requesters.js`.)
- `lambda/config.js` should contain all the values that need to be set to reconfigure it to work for a different business. I'm pleased that this is now only the App ID, and the names of the Meeting Rooms.

## Non-Intent Handlers

In order to make my code easier to read and debug, I made `nonIntentHandlers`, which are registered with the Intent Handlers, but which don't handle intents. For that reason, I prefaced all of them with a `:` just like the SDK does. Here is documentation for them:

- `:askHandler` - takes a `speechOutput` and a `repromptSpeech`. It stores these as session attributes, then calls `this.emit(':ask')` using the parameters above. This means that the last speech outputs are easily registered as session attributes, which allows Alexa to repeat itself. Can totally replace `this.emit(':ask')`.

- `:repeatHandler` - takes no parameters. Very simply calls `this.emit(':ask')` using the session attributes for the last things said.

- `:startOverHandler` - takes no parameters. Sets the state to an empty string (using the workaround detailed above), resets the attributes to undefined, then emits a `LaunchRequest`. Effectively resets the code.

- `:errorHandler` - takes one 'error' parameter. Designed to report all request errors. I suggest editing this one if you want to log errors in a different way. It both logs errors in the console, and puts them on a card to be seen in the Alexa app/web-app.

*All the remaining nonIntentHandlers are called successively by DurationIntent in TimeMode. Each one handles a different stage of the room finding process.*

- `:durationHandler` - takes a ISO-8601 duration parameter. Checks if it's valid, and not too long, then stores the start time, end time and duration as attributes. It then emits `:getRoomHandler`...

- `:getRoomHandler` - uses stored attributes to find a free room, then stores its credentials as attributes. It then emits `:roomFoundHandler`...

- `:roomFoundHandler` - checks if valid room was found, and if so changes the state to CONFIRMMODE.

**All the other handlers are the intent handlers.**

## Requesters

The `lambda/requesters.js` file contains a set of functions that make requests to the Microsoft Graph API. The available functions are `getCalendars()`, `postRoom()`, and `findFreeRoom()`. All of these functions return [Q promises](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) - I still personally think Q is still better supported than ES6 promises, which is why I used it. This means the appropriate way to use them is `requesters.function(...).then((returned) => {...})`.

All these functions also use the [request](https://github.com/request/request) module to make their API request.

#### getCalendars(token)

Passed a token, this just returns an promise resolved to an object showing the calendars in the default calendar list of the user, or it rejects with an error. The default calendar list of the user must include the meeting rooms, so they much be explicitly shared with Alexa's account.

#### findFreeRoom(token, startTime, endTime, names, parsedCals)

Passed a token, times formatted as values, the array of names of meeting rooms, and the object returned by getCalendars, this returns the a promise resolved to the key credentials of the first free room it finds.

It does this by looping through the `parsedCals` object. For each calendar:
 - Check if its name is in `names`.
 - If it is in `names`, get its calendarView for the specified time.
 - Check if its calendarView is empty for the specified time.
 - If it is empty, return some 'credentials' in a JSON. startTime and endTime with findFreeRoom and postRoom, or this could result in errors.
 Here's how the credentials are structured:
    ```
    {
      ownerName: "string", // e.g. Meeting Room 1.0
      ownerAddress: "string", // e.g. meetingroom1.0@business.com
      name: "string", // e.g. Meeting Room 1.0
    }
    ```
 - If all calendars either aren't in `names`, aren't `free`, or return errors, it rejects.

 API requests are done asynchronously.

 Note on the findFreeRoom method: This function is fairly manual in how it works out which of the calendars are available - it uses a simple counter, and if they're all unavailable it returns false. One could use `Q.any()` for almost the same effect, but I did this, and unless you further complicate the code, it gives much worse error messages. It requires me to reject calendars that are busy, rather than just rejecting errors; thus my code allows differentiation between errors and unavailability which `Q.any()` doesn't. The other alternative is `Q.allSettled()` but that requires every API request to finish before the code returns, which worsens performance.

#### postRoom(token, ownerAddress, ownerName, startTime, endTime)

Passed a token, an address to make a calendar on, the name of that calendar, and the same start time and end time as passed eariler, this posts a room.

It **does not directly write on the room resource calendar.** It instead posts an event on Alexa's calendar, and invites the room using the address provided. The benefit of this is that your account requires fewer permissions. The problem is it relies on the rooms accepting the invites.
